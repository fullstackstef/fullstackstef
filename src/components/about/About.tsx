          My name is Stefan and I enjoy building web applications and sharing my
          knowledge on the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my time in university studying criminology & business law, I
          worked as an assistant to a university software engineering professor
          at a private school teaching STEM and this is where my love for
          software development began.
        </p>
        <p>
          While eventually directing the coding program at the private school
          and deferring going to law school once graduating from my
          undergraduate, I decided to take the plunge and become a self-taught
          software developer, mainly focusing on building full stack web
          applications.

          From that moment onwards, Iâ€™ve been fortunate to work at companies{' '}
